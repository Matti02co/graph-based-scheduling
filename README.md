# graph-based-scheduling
Comparative study of process scheduling strategies: initial knapsack-based formulation solved with CPLEX and classical scheduling algorithms (SPF, FCFS), later reformulated as a graph problem and solved using CPLEX and shortest path algorithms. Demonstrates optimization modeling, algorithmic analysis, and graph theory applications.
